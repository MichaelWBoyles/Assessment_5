# Rick and Morty Stock Market game
- Assessment 5: 



##Description
    - Building a HTML game is something that interests me quite a bit. I have always dreamed of being a game designer and with this project I believe it should keep me interested. This will help in developing my skill and my understandings of building a website.
    - This build will be about making a Rick and Morty like profile and then to start trading stock in a fake Rick and Morty universe using real data from an actual stock market. The user will have a fun interactive view of buy and sell on an intergalactic scale. Grab your plumbus and Schmeckles and start trading.
    - This website will allow a new user/person to create a profile. Using the Rick and Morty API the user will be able to use any picture from the rick and Morty universe, along with their description. 
    - After creating a User/Person, a time machine will roll back the clock a few years grabbing old stock market data using a Stock Market History API. As well as, changing the name of the stock when presenting to the user. This will keep the stock anonymous. (And adding a funny Rick and Morty name and picture to each)
    - The home page will be a navigation bar at the top with a list of stocks below, and a “Advance Time” button to advance time of the stock market. click on each stock will give you information about the stock and price. The user will be able to click buy or sell.
    
- Extra goals: Having a shop to buy things and displaying them in your profile; Having it be real time if desired; Having other fake people(computer) buying and trading, then showing a top player
